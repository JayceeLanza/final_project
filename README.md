#The two data files included, MS263_FinalProject_Data_EggTiming.xlsx and MS263_FinalProject_Data_SettlementDensity.xlsx can be downloaded and used for analysis
#Variables in MS263_FinalProject_Data_SettlementDensity.xlsx
  #Dish: What dish the culture was grown in 
  #Culture_Type: Mono= monoculture, only one species present in the culture; Poly= Polyculture, multiple species present in the culture
  #Macro_Spores: The amount of Macrocystis pyrifera spores settled/ Feild of View under a microscope
  #Egregia_Spores: The amount of Egregia menziesii spores settled/ Feild of under a microscope
#Variables in MS263_FinalProject_Data_EggTiming.xlsx 
 #Species: Macro=Macrocystis pyrifera; Egregia = Egregia menziesii
 #Culture_Type: Mono= monoculture, only one species present in the culture; Poly= Polyculture, multiple species present in the culture
 #Light_Level: How much light each dish was exposed to
 #Day: Number of Days since settlement
 #Av_Eggs/FOV: Average number of eggs present in each field of view under a microscope
 #Ratio_Mature: The proportion of mature females (those with eggs) to total females in a sample
