#The two data files included, MS263_FinalProject_Data_EggTiming.xlsx and MS263_FinalProject_Data_SettlementDensity.xlsx can be downloaded and used for analysis


> Variables in MS263_FinalProject_Data_SettlementDensity.xlsx
> 1. Dish: What dish the culture was grown in 
> 2. Culture_Type: Mono= monoculture, only one species present in the culture; Poly= Polyculture, multiple species         present in the culture
> 3. Macro_Spores: The amount of Macrocystis pyrifera spores settled/ Feild of View under a microscope
> 4. Egregia_Spores: The amount of Egregia menziesii spores settled/ Feild of under a microscope


> Variables in MS263_FinalProject_Data_EggTiming.xlsx 
>1. Species: Macro=Macrocystis pyrifera; Egregia = Egregia menziesii
>2. Culture_Type: Mono= monoculture, only one species present in the culture; Poly= Polyculture, multiple species >present in the culture
> 4. Light_Level: How much light each dish was exposed to
> 5. Day: Number of Days since settlement
> 6. Av_Eggs/FOV: Average number of eggs present in each field of view under a microscope
> 7.Ratio_Mature: The proportion of mature females (those with eggs) to total females in a sample
