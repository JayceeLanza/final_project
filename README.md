# Final Project
===============
#### There is a file called raw_data cotaining the raw data used in this project. This data was cleaned up and organized into the data used for analyses. This file is not necessary to run the code, but does provide more insight into how the data was collected. 

#### The three data files used for analyes, MS263_FinalProject_Data_EggTiming.xlsx, MS263_FinalProject_Data_EggTiming.xlsx, and MS263_FinalProject_Data_SettlementDensity.xlsx can be downloaded and used for analysis


> Variables in MS263_FinalProject_Data_SettlementDensity.xlsx
> 1. Dish: What dish the culture was grown in 
> 2. Culture_Type: Mono= monoculture, only one species present in the culture; Poly= Polyculture, multiple species present in the culture
> 3. Macro_Spores: The amount of Macrocystis pyrifera spores settled/ Feild of View under a microscope
> 4. Egregia_Spores: The amount of Egregia menziesii spores settled/ Feild of View under a microscope

> Variables in MS263_FinalProject_Data_EggTiming.xlsx 
>1. Species: Macro=Macrocystis pyrifera; Egregia = Egregia menziesii
>2. Culture_Type: Mono= monoculture, only one species present in the culture; Poly= Polyculture, multiple species present in the culture
> 3. Light_Level: How much light each dish was exposed to
> 4. Day: Number of Days since settlement
> 5. Av_Eggs/FOV: Average number of eggs present in each field of view under a microscope
> 6.Ratio_Mature: The proportion of mature females (those with eggs) to total females in a sample

>1. pecies: Macro=Macrocystis pyrifera; Egregia = Egregia menziesii
>2. Culture_Type: Mono= monoculture, only one species present in the culture; Poly= Polyculture, multiple species >present in the culture
>3. Light_Level:Amount of light each dish was exposed to
>4. SporophytesperFemale: The number of sporophytes present in one field of view divided by the number of females per feild of view
>5. Days_50_Eggs: The number of days it took until at least 50% of females had produced an egg
